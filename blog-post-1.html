                        <div class="col-inner">
                          <p>I started to pack my clothes, toiletries, and other things that I will need for the upcoming training. With it, I also packed my dreams that I will bring to keep me going in times of hardships. As I zipped my bag, my mind started to wander.</p>
                          <p>My mind went to when I was just a young 12-year-old boy. I was skinny, had a dark-colored skin, and an unpresentable kind of look. You can find me in crowded streets. People call me the “newspaper boy.”</p>
                          <p>We lived a simple life back then. My father was a salesman while my mother was a housewife. Everything was fine until my father got fired, and my mother had to help him with our expenses. My sisters had to work too.</p>
                          <p>It was hard so I told myself that I would work harder to help my family. We continued with our lives until an accident happen.</p>
                          <p>I fell into the backdoor of the bus. My left leg got caught in its tire. All I can hear was the screaming of the crowd. I felt an excruciating pain in my leg. It was too painful that I felt it in my heart.</p>
                          <p>A good Samaritan helped me to get back on the bus, and took me to the hospital. Because of our financial condition, my father needed to go to charities and asked for help, and with God’s grace, we managed to pay the bills.</p>
                          <p>After the tragic accident, we were able to bounce back. My father got a part-time job, and I came back to school. I’ve started another chapter of my life.</p>
                          <p>Going back to school wasn’t easy. I was often bullied because of my disability. In spite of all the challenges, and with the support of my family, I finished college.</p>
                          <p>I sought for a job, and finally accepted as an I.T. administrator in a hospital. My salary wasn’t sustainable so I had to look for other jobs. After office hours, I did graphic design and online reselling of computer parts.</p>
                          <p>While searching for other jobs online, I saw job postings for virtual assistants and web writers. I was amazed to know that you can do all this from the comfort of your home.</p>
                          <p>Then, I discovered Adaptive Technology for Rehabilitation, Integration, and Empowerment of the Visually Impaired (ATRIEV). ATRIEV is an I.T. center that helps persons with disability by providing trainings that will uplift their skills.</p>
                          <p> That thought brought me to my senses. I glanced back into my bag. I got all the things that I need. I will be attending a Writing for the Web training to learn how to write online, and someday get a job. “It’s time to go.”</p>
